# thud-homelab

## Repo for my homelab project and notes.

## Azure
Currently building out a proxy server through an Azure Linux VM utilizing Terraform. In the project is that main file. 

## In my home
I am putting together an old alienware aurora r5 that I was given to fo free because there was a RAID issue with the machine. I have learned there is more to it and I'm working on a fix. I plan on running multiple virtual machines to act as various servers like a media server for instance. Stick around if you would like! 

Best,
Tyler
